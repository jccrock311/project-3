# Wildfire Awareness: The Varying Causes, Costs, and Concerns of the 21st Century

## Description:

Our goal is to visually and statistcially showcase the impact humans have had on wildfire creation over natural causes. Looking specifically from 2001-2022, we will examine what factors play significant roles in their emergence by showcasing causes and locales, emphasizing their spread, acreage, and overall financial and ecological costs.

## Main question:

What are the primary factors influencing the occurrence and severity of  wildfires in North America?

## Key Considerations:
	
- Causes (Humans vs. Nature):
	- How many wildfires were human-caused, both yearly and in total?
	- How many wildfires naturally occurred, and by, what means, both yearly and in total?
  
- Location (Regionally):
	- Regionally, where did these fires occur?
	- Stately, where did these fires occur?
	- Ecologically, were the numbers impactful?
  
- Spread (Severity, Acreage):
	- Which fires were the most severe?
	- What was the average spread of fires regionally?
	- How many acres in years (and in total) have been burned during our respective timeframe?
  
- Costs (Services, Damages):
	- What kinds of costs were the most expensive?
	- What was the average cost of fire damage yearly and in total?

## Findings

1. According to our charts, across the past 20 years, human-started wildfires have caused considerably more financial and ecological stresses compared to those started of natural causes.
