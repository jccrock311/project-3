# Wildfire Awareness: The Varying Causes, Costs, and Concerns of the 21st Century

## Description:

Our goal is to visually and statistcially showcase the impact humans have had on wildfire creation over natural causes. Looking specifically from 2001-2022, we will examine what factors play significant roles in their emergence by showcasing causes and locales, emphasizing their spread, acreage, and overall financial and ecological costs.

## Main question:

What are the primary factors influencing the occurrence and severity of  wildfires in North America?

## Key Considerations:
	
- Causes (Humans vs. Nature):
	- How many wildfires were human-caused, both yearly and in total?
	- How many wildfires naturally occurred, and by, what means, both yearly and in total?
  
- Location (Regionally):
	- Regionally, where did these fires occur?
	- Stately, where did these fires occur?
	- Ecologically, were the numbers impactful?
  
- Spread (Severity, Acreage):
	- Which fires were the most severe?
	- What was the average spread of fires regionally?
	- How many acres in years (and in total) have been burned during our respective timeframe?
  
- Costs (Services, Damages):
	- What kinds of costs were the most expensive?
	- What was the average cost of fire damage yearly and in total?

## Findings

1. According to our charts, across the past 20 years, human-started wildfires have caused considerably more financial and ecological stresses spanning all major US regions compared to those started of natural causes.
2. As the years progress, there is a clear indication that the costs spent on wildfire retention grows exponentially, almost reaching 4x the amount spent in 2021 compared to 2001. This could be indicative of climate change, requiring more resources to keep fires contained, as well as inflation in costs, or a mixture of both.
